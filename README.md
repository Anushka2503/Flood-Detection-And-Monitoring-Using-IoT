# 🌊 Flood Detection and Monitoring Using IoT

This project aims to detect and monitor flood conditions using IoT sensors and machine learning techniques. A mobile application alerts local users about flood risks and provides emergency support through an SOS feature.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To provide early flood alerts by combining real-time water level monitoring, weather data, and intelligent flood prediction, ultimately helping local people take timely action.
